# Deep Convolutional GAN
This is a project in the course *IDATT2502 - Applied Machine Learning* at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) by:
- Carl Johan GÃ¼tzkow
- Eirik Elvestad
- Tomas Beranek
  
In this project we have developed a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network**.
